Question 1 - Weka
Linear Regression Equation:
Here, class is MEDV.
class =
     -0.1084 * CRIM    +
      0.0458 * ZN      +
      2.7187 * CHAS=1  +
    -17.376  * NOX     +
      3.8016 * RM      +
     -1.4927 * DIS     +
      0.2996 * RAD     +
     -0.0118 * TAX     +
     -0.9465 * PTRATIO +
      0.0093 * B       +
     -0.5226 * LSTAT   +
     36.3411

The number of terms in the equation are 12. The first 11 are weight multiplied with features and the last term is the bias/intercept.


Due to the M5 attribute selection method that is being used here, we first build the equation on all the terms. After which, the terms with the smallest standardized regression coefficients are removed in a stepwise manner until no improvement can be seen in the estimate of the average prediction error given by the Akaike information criterion. 
In this case, INDUS, AGE and CHAS = 0 are removed as they do not affect the error value.
